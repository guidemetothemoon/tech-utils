# Technical utilities

This repository contains a collection of different utilities and helpful resources like scripts, cheatsheets, etc., across different areas.

Below is an overview of what different folders are about (content is being added continuously):

- [cheatsheets](./cheatsheets/) - contains visualized, more graphical overview of useful commands or key information related to a specific domain.
- [scripts](./scripts/) - contains scripts with dependencies (if applicable) that help solve a specific task. These may be referenced in my [tech blog](https://kristhecodingunicorn.com)
